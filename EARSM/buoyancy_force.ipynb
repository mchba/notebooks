    "A buoyancy force is due to the Earth's gravitational field, hence the force is parallel to $g_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ - g \\end{pmatrix}$, where $g = 9.807~\\mathrm{m}~\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$ at the Earth's surface. At 1 km above the surface, we have $g = 9.804~\\mathrm{m}~\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, hence it is a good assumption to say that $g$ is a constant, both in engineering and atmospheric flows.\n",
