    "Eq. 1 is the same as the channel flow equation, except with $P_{eff}$ instead of $P$. It will make no difference for us, because we fix the pressure term to obtain a specific $u_\\tau$. Eq. 2 shows that when $\\Omega > 0$ (CCW rotating channel), then there we have $dP_{eff}/dy < 0$! This explains why there is a suction side at the top wall.\n",

    "The amount of system rotation, $\\Omega$, is sometimes expressed with the non-dimensional rotation number, $Ro_\\tau \\equiv \\frac{2 \\Omega h}{u_\\tau}$. Another non-dimensional number is the \"stabilization number\" $S \\equiv \\frac{2 \\Omega }{- \\frac{dU}{dy}}$, which is the background vorticity (rigid body motion of the channel) divided by flow field vorticity. At points in space where $S > 0$, the turbulence is dampenend, while turbulence is enhanced where $S < 0$ (Anderson 1993, p.164). This is the reason for the skewed TKE profile in the sketch above.\n",
